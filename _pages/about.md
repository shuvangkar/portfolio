## Experiences
- **Research Assistant, SPSC Lab, Clarkson University**

- **Senior IoT Engineer 2020 March – 2021 May adorsho praniSheba Ltd, Dhaka**
I have developed three cutting-edge IoT products focusing precision modern cattle farming for adorsho praniSheba. The products were biosensor for cattle know as bolus, Base Station for managing Bolus sensor network, environment sensor for cowshed.
- **Embedded System Engineer (part-time) 2017 May-2017 Sep IICT, BUET**
The key role comprises designing a development board based on Microchip PIC18F microcontroller. So, the main tasks include designing circuits and PCB, fabricating PCB, testing circuit & writing chapter-wise code for the courseware.
