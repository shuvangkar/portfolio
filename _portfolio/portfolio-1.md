Project Information
Project Supervisor :

Dr. Shahidul Islam Khan, Professor, Dept. of EEE, BUET
Dr. Md. Ziaur Rahman Khan, Professor, Dept. of EEE, BUET
Project Type: Open Source Design Development

Funded By: IEEE Power and Energy Society(PES)

Project duration: 1 Year


This was my first power electronics project and one of the significant projects I have done so far. Actually, I have started my power electronics journey by this project. Not only that, I have grown my interest in Power Electronics by this project. I have learned so many things doing this project including MOSFET Driving, different types of power electronics topologies implementations, device heat management, different types of hardware problem solving etc.

The project was funded by IEEE Power and Energy Society and We have completed the project as student volunteers. The purpose of the project was to develop an open source design of 1KW Pure Sine wave inverter. After project completion, It was presented in the IEEE PES General Meeting 2016 by Dr. Shahidul Islam Khan & Dr. Md. Ziaur Rahman Khan
