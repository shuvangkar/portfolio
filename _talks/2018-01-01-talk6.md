The workshop was organized IEEE Stamford University Student Branch in a collaboration with IEEE SAC BD Section.  The number of participants was  30  and it has a half-day workshop on Pure Sine Wave Inverter Design Technique

I have mainly discussed the problems of designing Sine Wave inverter which includes  H-Bridge Driving mechanism, Transformer design for DC-DC boost, Filter Design, PCB design, components selection etc.
